# Create a waiting room from the dashboard

## Before you begin

Before you begin to work with waiting rooms, review the [prerequisites](/about#prerequisites) and [entitlements](/about#entitlements).

Before configuring a waiting room, consider the following:

* How you want the waiting room to operate
* The appearance of the waiting room

### Waiting room operation

First, decide which routes must be served by a waiting room. Routes are pages or applications in your website. You can link a route with only one waiting room, so you need to identify the high-traffic areas of your website. These routes are represented by the following parameters in Cloudflare Waiting Rooms:



### What your waiting room will look like

Consider the appearance of your waiting room. This is what the visitor will see when queuing to access a route.
Cloudflare provides a template waiting room page to get you started, but you can edit this or upload your own HTML file. In the waiting room template, Cloudflare provides code that presents visitors with an estimated entry time to the route: including this in your waiting room page improves customer experience.
